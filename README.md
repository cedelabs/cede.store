# cede.store 

## Introduction

Cede.store is a non-custodial browser extension to store CEX (centralized exchanges) API keys and to sign CEX requests 
from the client-side. It allows you to manage your cryptos in your CEX through a unique interface, with a familiar UX, 
much like the well-known DeFi browser wallets (e.g. Metamask).

Any dApp can integrate cede.store in order to track and/or manage a user's CEX assets. In that way,
we offer the dApp a way to track and manage a user's CEX assets while staying non-custodial 
and keeping the same UX as any DeFi browser wallet.
